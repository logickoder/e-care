# E-Care Mobile
### Ecare-mobile-pjt14
E-care focuses on achieving SDGs goal number three (good health and well-being). This app contains two main features namely:
- Health record management, which provides solution to hospital record mismanagement, which has in turn led to loss of several lives and
- Rural-connect, which focuses on extending good health care to rural dwellers by connecting the rural community health care providers with their senior counterparts at urban health centres closest to them, so as to receive guidance in handling emergencies and other critical conditions.
